## Hello

The first program you will experience as a programmer learning a new language is the _Hello World Program_.

```python3
print("Hello World")
```

which displays

```
>> Hello World
```

## Run it!

Open our Colab notebook to run this program for yourself.

[Colab Link](...)

## Modify it!

Change the program to print _Hello Matt_ instead of _Hello World_.
Run your program to prove that it works.

## Modify it again!

Change your program to print _Hello World_ and _Hello Matt_ by duplicating the line of code to have two print statements.

```python3
print("Hello World")
print("Hello Matt")
```

Run your program to show that it works!

## Congratulations

You've just ran your first program and modified it to accomplish a task. We'll be building on this simple example with more, 2 minute exercises, to increase your confidence.
