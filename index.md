# Learning Python with Google Colab

## Learning Goals

The purpose of this course is to:
1. Teach you Python programming language basics
2. Help you begin to think *algorithmically*

The format of this course is 6 lessons, each no more than 20 - 30 minutes in length. In each course, you will learn some new programming concept and apply it in a few programming exercises. Each exercise is only a few lines of code designed to help you gain confidence in the material you have just learned and prepare you for the next lesson.

## The Bright Horizon

The final exercise you will complete is a guessing game, in which your program will continuously prompt a player to guess the number it is thinking of.
