## Hello World

The first program you will experience as a programmer learning a new language is the _Hello World Program_.

```python3
print("Hello World")
```

which displays

```
>> Hello World
```

## Run it!

Open our Colab notebook to run this program for yourself.

## Modify it!

Change the program to print _Hello Matt_ instead of _Hello World_.
Run your program to prove that it works.

## Modify it again!

Change your program to print _Hello World_ and _Hello Matt_ by duplicating the line of code to have two print statements.

```python3
print("Hello World")
print("Hello Matt")
```

Run your program to show that it works! You should see

```
>> Hello World
>> Hello Matt
```
